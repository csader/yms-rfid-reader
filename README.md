based on MintyBox from nomcon 2019

"/software/MintyBox_ymstest2.py" is the latest working code that currently checks the "authorized.txt" file to see if a badge id is listed, then unlocks a lock for 3 seconds, then re-locks it

"/software/MintyBox_ymstest.py" was my attempt at reading a CSV file generated through "Apitest3.py" - which downloads a list of members with badge ids from Wild Apricot
